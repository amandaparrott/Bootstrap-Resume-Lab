#Bootstrap Resume

In this lab, the goal is to recreate the resume that is found in the PDF provided.

Hints:
*Remember that you need a container, row and columns and that you can have multiple rows on the page at once. You could put the header in one row, the skills in another. It's up to you, but think about it logically. 
*You might want to check out these components: alerts, list groups, cards, and jumbotron.
*Using col-md as a breakpoint will help make your resume look better in mobile view. You can see what you resume looks like on a mobile screen in your chrome developer tools.
